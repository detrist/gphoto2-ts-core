## Development

### Use as a template

(If you do not use GitHub, you can [download the archive of the example package](https://github.com/detrist/gphoto2-ts-core/archive/main.zip))

### Set up tools and environment

You need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed. Node includes npm as its default package manager.

Open the whole package folder with a good code editor, preferably [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). Consider installing VS Code extensions [ES Lint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) and [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode).

In the VS Code top menu: **Terminal** -> **New Terminal**

### Install dependencies

Install dependencies with npm:

```bash
npm i
```

### Write your code

Make necessary changes in **package.json** (name, version, description, keywords, author, homepage and other URLs).

Write your code in **src** folder, and unit test in **test** folder, replacing the original files there.

The VS Code shortcuts for formatting of a code file are: <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>F</kbd> (Windows); <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Option (Alt)</kbd> + <kbd>F</kbd> (MacOS); <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>I</kbd> (Linux).

Change code linting and formatting settings in **.prettierrc.js** if you want.

### Test

Test your code with Jest framework:

```bash
npm run test
```

**Note:** Example TypeScript Package uses [husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/), [pinst](https://github.com/typicode/pinst) and [commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org/) to automatically execute test and [lint commit message](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) before every commit.

### Build

Build production (distribution) files in your **dist** folder:

```bash
npm run build
```

It generates CommonJS (in **dist/cjs** folder), ES Modules (in **dist/esm** folder), bundled and minified UMD (in **dist/umd** folder), as well as TypeScript declaration files (in **dist/types** folder).

### Try it before publishing

Run:

```bash
npm link
```

[npm link](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/commands/npm-link) will create a symlink in the global folder, which may be **{prefix}/lib/node_modules/gphoto2-ts-core** or **C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\npm\node_modules\gphoto2-ts-core**.

Create an empty folder elsewhere, you don't even need to `npm init` (to generate **package.json**). Open the folder with VS Code, open a terminal and just run:

```bash
npm link gphoto2-ts-core
```

This will create a symbolic link from globally-installed gphoto2-ts-core to **node_modules/** of the current folder.

You can then create a, for example, **testnum.ts** file with the content:

```ts
import { Camera } from 'gphoto2-ts-core'
let camera: Camera = new Camera()
...
camera.captureImages((chunk: Buffer) => {
  console.log(chunk)
}, 20, DEFAULT_FRAMES)
```

If you don't see any linting errors in VS Code, if you put your mouse cursor over `Camera` and see its type, then it's all good.

Whenever you want to uninstall the globally-installed gphoto2-ts-core and remove the symlink in the global folder, run:

```bash
npm uninstall gphoto2-ts-core -g
```
